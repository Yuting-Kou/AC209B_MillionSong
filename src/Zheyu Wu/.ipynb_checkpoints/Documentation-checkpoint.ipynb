    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The recorded music industry has been flourishing over the past ten years. It has generated a revenue of 9.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 alone, and experts anticipate that this trend will continue [1]. Predicting a song’s popularity has been drawing a broad range of interest not only from singers and record producers, but also from investors and machine learning researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "In this project, we will try to look into a range of song attributes from the Million Song Dataset [2], and extract key characteristics that determine a song’s hotness. Based on these key characteristics, we will build several machine learning models to predict a new song’s hotness. Finally, we will evaluate these models and benchmark them with regards to the baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our goal is to propose an end-to-end data pipeline, which includes data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, to accurately predict the hotness of a song.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Question\n",
    "In order to achieve the project goal above, we need to answer this question: what are the key characteristics of a song and how do they determine the song’s hotness? To be more specific, we need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "● What is the definition of the hotness of a song? Can we replace the song’s hotness attribute with other data given that this attribute is missing in near half of the songs?\n",
    "\n",
    "● What are the most important attributes in determining a song’s hotness?\n",
    "\n",
    "● Are there any new features that we can add to the existing dataset to improve the prediction accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **rest of this report, we will address these questions individually**.\n",
